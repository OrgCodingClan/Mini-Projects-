#About
This Python script is designed to automate text input using the PyAutoGUI library. It can be useful for scenarios where repetitive typing is required, such as testing or data entry. The script simulates keyboard input to repeatedly type a specified message and press "enter" at regular intervals.

#code

import pyautogui
import time
time.sleep(3)

while(True):
    pyautogui.typewrite("Type your Message here")
    pyautogui.press("enter")
time.sleep(3)
